# Machine Learning Project: Iris Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the famous Iris dataset using machine learning techniques. It includes visualization of the dataset, implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, and calculation of Euclidean distance.

## Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of various iris flowers. It consists of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species label.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - The `visualize_iris_dataset.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains code for visualizing the Iris dataset using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. It includes various plots and charts to explore the relationships between different features and species.

2. **KNN Algorithm Implementation**:
   - The `knn_algorithm.py` Python script implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch. It includes functions for training the model, making predictions, and evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy.

3. **Euclidean Distance Calculation**:
   - The `euclidean_distance.py` Python script calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space. It is used as a distance metric in the KNN algorithm for finding the nearest neighbors.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `visualize_iris_dataset.ipynb` to visualize the Iris dataset.
4. Run the Python script `knn_algorithm.py` to train the KNN model and make predictions.
5. Use the Python script `euclidean_distance.py` to calculate Euclidean distance between data points.
